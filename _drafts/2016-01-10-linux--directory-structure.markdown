## Introduction

I've made it a goal this year to learn a bit more about Linux in general. In the past I've gotten by with spotty knowledge of how the system works; but I've never been able to get very far with troubleshooting distributions without having to consult Google on basically everything I try to achieve.

It's fitting that the first thing I explore is the most confusing, but also the most important part; The core file system and directory structure.

I'm only going to cover the top level directories for now, so I'll try my best to give just enough description to get by.

## A bit of History
