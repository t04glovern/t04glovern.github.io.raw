### Who am I?

I'm a Full time Computer Science student who is also currently working as a sysadmin part time. When I'm not cramming for exams or working I'm normally expanding my skillsets by trying/experimenting new things.

Here is a picture of me being all professional:

I was on a reality show a few year back which resulted in me growing a really bad beard. The results are as follows:

### What's the point?

I just want a place I can share/post my thoughts or just descriptions or problems that I face. Because I'm constantly trying to learn new things my focus jumps around and I regularly forget things that I would consider to be important.
