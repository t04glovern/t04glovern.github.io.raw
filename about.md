## <center>Who am I?</center>

***

I'm a Full time Computer Systems student who is also currently working as a Sysadmin part time. When I'm not cramming for exams or working I'm normally expanding my skillsets by trying/experimenting new things.

Here is a picture of me being all professional:

I was on a reality show a few year back which resulted in me growing a really bad beard. The results are as follows:

I love everything tech and spend my free time working on learning as much as I can. If you want to see some of the skills and experience I've gathered over the years; check out my [CV]({{ site.url }}/cv.html)

## <center>What's the Plan?</center>

***

I just want a place I can share/post my thoughts or just descriptions or problems that I face. Because I'm constantly trying to learn new things my focus jumps around and I regularly forget things that I would consider to be important.
