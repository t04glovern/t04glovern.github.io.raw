## Introduction

As part of a program through my University and [CoderdojoWA](http://www.coderdojowa.org.au/) I've been asked to oversee a project relating to image manipulation in Python using the [Python Image Library](http://pythonware.com/products/pil/). While I wasn't the one to write the guide, I have been asked to test and confirm I understand it well enough to be able to teach the content mid February this year.
