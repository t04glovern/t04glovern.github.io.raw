## Overview

Over the past couple years OneNote has been my life. I decided I'd share some of the small quirks and modification you can use to make it better for you as well.

#### Import PDF/Documents

OneNote installs its own printing device that has the capabilities of converting anything you print through it into a OneNote document.

To use this device, simply print a document as you normally would and select `Send To OneNote %Year%` as the device.

**NOTE:** The printer defaults all documented to portrait orientation, If you know your document is better optimised in landscape you will need to set that yourself in the Printer Preferences menu.

You will be prompted to then choose the location you would like to insert content. Depending on the size of the document and number of pages OneNote might separate the document into multiple sub-pages. I personally find this annoying, but luckily there's a way to force it to always put documented under a single page.

In the OneNote app, go to `File > Options > Advanced` and scroll down to the `Printouts` section. In here you can uncheck `Insert long printouts on multiple pages`. I would also recommend enabling `Automatically set inserted file printouts in the background` as this setting makes it easier to do markups without moving the underlying document around.
