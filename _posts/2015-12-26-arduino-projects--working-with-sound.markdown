# Introduction

Tonight we're going to be looking into how sound is produced and also run through the steps required to get our `Arduino` to produce sound. The `Arduino`can produce sounds a number of ways; The simplest method, and the one we're going to look into is the [`tone()`](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Tone) function.

# Understanding how a speaker works

Sound is transmitted through the air as a pressure wave. As an object such as a speaker, drum, or a bell vibrates, that object also vibrates the air around it. As the air particles vibrate, they transfer energy to the particles around them, vibrating these particles as well. This chain reaction creates a pressure wave that is transferred from the sound source to your eardrum.

When we create a sound with our Arduino we can control two properties of these vibrating particles; Frequency and Amplitude.

1. `Frequency` - represents how quickly the air particles vibrate back and forth.
* High Frequency = sounds are a higher pitch (soprano)
* Low Frequency = sounds are a lower pitch (bass)

2. `Amplitude` - represents the magnitude of their vibrations.
* High Amplitude = sounds are louder
* Low Amplitude = sounds are quieter

Example the waveforms below, specifically lets take a look at `Middle C`

![Speaker Waveform]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/arduino-speaker-waves.jpg)

`Middle C` has a `frequency of 261.63 Hertz (Hz)`. In other words, a speaker, a guitar string, or a piano string would complete `261.63 oscillations per second`. We find the period of that by taking `1 / 261.62` which equals `3.822 milliseconds`, which is the width of one complete oscillation in the graph. We can use that value and set it as the period for a square wave and thus adjust the tone of a note.

`NOTE:` Since the Arduino cannot create a true sinusoidal wave that you'd normally hear in the real world, we have to work with a plain square wave. The square wave oscillates between `HIGH` and `LOW` while switching instantly, instead of slowly like a sine wave. This results in a pressure wave that doesn't fade off over time, leaving you with just a solid tone.

Looking at the speaker above, we can step through the process used to make a tone through a speaker.

1. There's a permanent magnet mounted behind the voice coil and pole piece

2. We send a sinusoidal voltage signal (or a square wave in the case of the Arduino) into the leads of the coil

3. The changing current induces a magnetic field that causes the voice coil and diaphragm to vibrate up and down as the permanent magnet is attracted to and then repulsed by the magnetic field that was generated.

4. This back-and-forth vibration, in turn, vibrates the air in front of the speaker, effectively creating a sound wave that can travel to your eardrum.

# Using the tone() function

`Arduino IDE` includes a built-in function for easily making sounds with arbitrary frequencies. The [`tone()`](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Tone) function generates a square wave of the selected frequency on the output pin of your choice. The tone() function accepts three arguments:

1. `pin` - the pin on which to generate the tone

2. `frequency` - the frequency of the tone in hertz (unsigned int)

3. `duration` - the duration of the tone in milliseconds (optional); If this argument is not set, the tone continues playing until you call [`noTone()`](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/NoTone).

Lets have a look at some code from the [Arduino community reference page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ToneMelody?from=Tutorial.Tone).

To start with we hook up `positive` line from our `speaker` to `Digital Pin 8` on the `Arduino`. Lets add this line to our code defining the pin 8 constant:

{% highlight java %}
// Pin for tone output
const int tonePin = 8;
{% endhighlight java %}

Next we'll create a little melody for our Arduino to play. We can do this using an `array` called `melody` with our notes listed in each subsequent slot.

{% highlight java %}
// Melody of notes
int melody[] = {NOTE_C4, NOTE_G3, NOTE_G3, NOTE_A3, NOTE_G3, 0, NOTE_B3, NOTE_C4};
{% endhighlight java %}

You'll now notice that the notes we've referenced in the array don't exist anywhere. Each of those note variables need to reference an `integer` value defining their `pitch`. You could go through and work these out yourself, but that would be silly; especially because there's already a great list provided on the [Tone Tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ToneMelody?from=Tutorial.Tone) page.

Go ahead and press `Ctrl+Shift+N` or select the `arrow` in the `right hand corner` of the Arduino IDE and click `New Tab`. Name the new file `pitches.h` and paste the following code into the IDE:

Save that file and navigate back to your tone project we were working on before.

Next we'll define the tones duration, and again we'll use a matching `array of integers`

{% highlight java %}
// note durations: 4 = quarter note, 8 = eighth note, etc.:
int noteDurations[] = {4, 8, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4};
{% endhighlight java %}

Now that we have a tune setup and defined we can move into the `setup()` block and begin writing the code that will play our tones.

{% highlight java %}
void setup() {
  // iterate over the notes of the melody:
  for (int thisNote = 0; thisNote < 8; thisNote++) {

    // to calculate the note duration, take one second
    // divided by the note type.
    //e.g. quarter note = 1000 / 4, eighth note = 1000/8, etc.
    int noteDuration = 1000 / noteDurations[thisNote];
    tone(tonePin, melody[thisNote], noteDuration);

    // to distinguish the notes, set a minimum time between them.
    // the note's duration + 30% seems to work well:
    int pauseBetweenNotes = noteDuration * 1.30;
    delay(pauseBetweenNotes);
    // stop the tone playing:
    noTone(tonePin);
  }
}

void loop() {
  // no need to repeat the melody.
}
{% endhighlight java %}

Run your code and enjoy the jams! Note that since we haven't setup this code to `loop`; you'll need to either reboot your `Arduino` or press the `reset button` on the board to get the tone to replay. You could even move the code block in `setup()` down into `loop()` to get it to continuously play the tones.

# Conclusion

I wish I had more to say on this topic, It turned out to be a lot easier than I expected. I hope to expand on some ideas with the speaker in some later projects; but for now it was great to just learn the fundamental details about how a speaker actually works. I hope it was helpful for you as well :)
